# SIO

**Sio** is an Elixir package that allows you to redirect logs
that would typically go to `stdout` into a separate terminal
tab. This is useful for keeping your primary terminal output
clean and organized, while still being able to view logs in a
dedicated tab for debugging or monitoring purposes.

With **Sio**, you can easily manage log visibility across
different tabs, streamlining your development workflow.
